# Retro Jerseys
## - An ecommerce site for selling retro NBA jerseys

Retro Jerseys is an ecommerce site for buying retro nba jerseys, mainly from the 90's and 2000's era. 
The purpose of the site for enthusiasts in the niche to buy hard to find jerseys, or sell their own collection through the site. 
Its a simple ecommerce webiste, which requires membership to buy from the site.
Since the success of the "Sneakerhead" market, I feel it is an angle not yet taken within the sports entusiast/memorabilia/fashion industry.


UX


The UX i wanted to achieve was ease of use at all times, i wanted a full purchase to take  minimal clicks and clear display of product and price. 
My Ux focus was on ease of access and making all products available quickly findable, the desirable black and white styling fo the backround allows the real focus, the coloured jerseys, to stand out in the store section of the page.
There are few but valuable calls to action on the home page both to sign up for the site, to allow acces, and to traverse the simple html pages. 



User Stories:
There are 2 key users I would like to use this page with scale to grow out from this starting niche.

User 1: The Buyer
I am a nostalgic Jersey Enthusiast, looking to buy a 90's Nba jersey for a friend. I havent been able to find a particular jersey (Such as say a Black Pippen Jersey from the 90's). 
I want to buy a Jersey online to send to my friend as a gift. I want the process to be quick as i often get lost on other retail website, Too many clicks!

User 2:The Seller
I am a collector of Retro Jerseys, and I'm Looking to sell off some of my collection but cant deal with the hassle of meeting potential buyers. 
I want a quick way of contacting a retailer to sell the jersey on my behalf, All i want is to send it off for a good price and have the money sent back to me.


User 3: The Window Shopper
I want to browse some old jerseys because i was a big fan of the styles of jerseys over the years, I want to buy one but im not yet sure if im ready to buy and i dont want to give over any of my details to any sites.

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

Feature 1 - Membership
  This allows all users to access the full capabilities of the store, allowing them to access the cart and to add to the cart.
  The purpose of this feature is to get minimum information off the users in an effort to protect their personal information 

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
